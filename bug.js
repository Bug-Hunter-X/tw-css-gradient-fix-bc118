```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 ...">
  </div>
```
This code might produce unexpected results if the `...` part contains conflicting Tailwind classes related to background colors or gradients.  For example, using `bg-red-500` within the same element would create a conflict, resulting in unpredictable visual output instead of a smooth gradient.
