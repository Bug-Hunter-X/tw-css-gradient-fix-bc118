# Tailwind CSS Gradient Conflict

This repository demonstrates a potential issue when using Tailwind CSS gradients in conjunction with other background-related classes.  The problem arises from conflicting style declarations, leading to unexpected visual behavior. The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` presents a corrected version.

## Problem
When applying multiple background-related Tailwind classes, including gradient classes, within the same element, conflicting declarations can override each other, producing results that deviate from expectations.

## Solution
To resolve this, ensure that the gradient class is the most specific and avoid applying conflicting classes like other background colors directly to the same element.
